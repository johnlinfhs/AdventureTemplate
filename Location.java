/**
 * A class representing a location.  This class is just a container to store a row and column.
 * It has two uses.
 * 
 * First, to return a row and column from a method we need a single object that holds both.
 * This object is it.
 * 
 * Second, to provide some general helper methods having to do with direction.  For example,
 * if we at row 3 and column 2 and we head northeast, where are we now?
 * 
 * This class provides methods to answer those sorts of questions.
